## apecs examples

Two examples for [apecs](https://github.com/jonascarpay/apecs).
Split out from the main module to avoid extra dependencies.

Build with `stack build && stack exec rts`, see [here](https://github.com/jonascarpay/apecs/blob/master/tutorials/RTS.md) for a tutorial.
Requires SDL2, see [here](https://github.com/haskell-game/sdl2) for installation instructions.
