# phycs

2D physics engine for games, with optional simple rendering.

- [apecs](https://github.com/jonascarpay/apecs) for syntax/interface/memory management with minimal overhead.
- [Chipmunk](https://github.com/slembcke/Chipmunk2D) for C-speed physics.
- [gloss](https://github.com/benl23x5/gloss) for rendering. Can easily be replaced by your own rendering engine.
- [inline-c](https://github.com/fpco/inline-c) for easy binding to Chipmunk.

Run `stack build && stack exec tumbler` for a demonstration.

Still in heavy development.
Feel free to create an issue or PR for suggestions/questions/requests/critiques/spelling fixes/etc.
See [TODO.md](https://github.com/jonascarpay/phycs/blob/master/TODO.md) for suggestions if you want to help out with the code.
